    <p>
        So, a little bit about me. I'm 34 years old, a mom of 4 beautiful children.
        I have a master degree in English lingustics from Ben Gurion University.
        Until not long ago, I have been teaching English for 5 point students and 
        also lecturing. However, I have recently decided to have a change in career and embark 
        on a new journey and that is<span class = "enhance">programming</span>. I'm mainly intersted in Back end development positions and would
        love starting my own company/strat-up which will hopefully assist people with their daily needs.
